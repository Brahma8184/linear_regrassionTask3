In this project, we implement and understand both simple and multiple Linear Regression using Scikit-learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib. First, we import and preprocess the dataset by loading the data, checking for missing values, and selecting important features (independent variables) and the target (dependent variable). Then, we split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance properly. We fit a Linear Regression model using sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression, allowing the model to learn the relationship between features and the target. After training, we predict outcomes on test data and evaluate the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (RÂ²) to measure prediction accuracy. Finally, we plot the regression line against actual data points and interpret the model coefficients, which tell us how much the target value changes with respect to each feature.
